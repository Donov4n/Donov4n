# Hello, i'm Donovan ðŸ‘‹ 

<img align="right" alt="To infinity and beyond!" height="300px" src="./assets/illu.gif" />

I'm a french senior web engineer currently working primarily with __Javascript__ for building better front-ends. 
(but i have also a solid background in PHP, DevOps (Chef, Docker, CI / CD), Ruby and others tools / languages)

My work is quite oriented around tooling, developer experience and great & responsive interfaces.

### Our work at Pulsanova

I currently work for [Pulsanova](https://pulsanova.com), a web agency specialized in __migrating legacy apps__ to current 
and proven technologies (e.g. jQuery / Twig => React / Vue SPA) with a particular concern to accompany the 
teams in place on this new stack (with long-terme support / code-review / online workshop and more).

__Why migrate to new technologies when what we use already do the job? ðŸ¤”__

The web is slow, especially with legacy technologies not adapted to today's internet and to the expectations of our visitors.  
(and the last thing you want is to lose your visitors because your application is slow, whether it's felt or real)

ðŸš€ We propose to put in place __tools and best practices__ to give your frontend a feeling of instantaneousness / reactivity, 
rework the UX (user experience) and as a bonus, our intervention generally reduces the "technical debt", accumulated over the years.
We also set up tools to ensure the quality and durability of the code.

Unfortunately I don't have the space here to list all the benefits that our intervention can have on your application (and therefore, your business), 
so don't hesitate to [contact me directly](mailto:donovan@pulsanova.com), I will be happy to discuss it with you.
